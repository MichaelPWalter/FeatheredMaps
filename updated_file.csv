Struthio camelus,ostric2,Common Ostrich," Field Identification Male 210–275 cm, 100–156 kg; female 175–190 cm, 90–110 kg. Unmistakable, the largest bird species; wholly terrestrial, flightless. Male nominatebreeding has almost bare skin of most of head and neck and of thighs reddish, short stiff brownish feathers encircling bald crown and extending down hindneck; feathered lower neck black, bordered above by ring of white feathers; body and all wing-coverts black; remiges and tail white, sometimes stained brownish by soil; iris brown; upper mandible yellowish, lower mandible red; legs reddish. Non-breeding male is similar to breeding, but bare areas of neck and thighs duller, more pinkish (less red). Female is like male, but duller; dark feathers browner, less black, wing and tail greyer, bare areas duller and greyer, with greater amount of downy feathering; as with male, neck and bill become redder during breeding. Juvenile resembles female, but more grey-brown, with downy neck feathering denser; the male acquiring whitish remiges and tail in 2nd year. Immature similar to female, but darker."," Similar Species Distinguished from Somali Ostrich (S. molybdophanes) by pink, reddish or pinkish-grey vs strong grey-blue neck and legs ; paler black plumage ; lack of black scutes on lower tarsi ; dark brown vs pale brownish-grey eye (greyish-blue in female) ; crown with short, stiff feathering vs bare crown ; largely parapatric distribution (1, 2)."," Systematics History Previously considered conspecific with S. molybdophanes but the two differ significantly in plumage and bare parts, genetically and behaviourally. Since turn of century both commonly given species status, and this view accepted here. Distinguished from S. molybdophanes by pink, reddish or pinkish-grey vs strong grey-blue neck and legs ; paler black plumage ; lack of black scutes on lower tarsi ; dark brown vs pale brownish-grey eye (greyish-blue in female) ; crown with short, stiff feathering vs bare crown ; largely parapatric distribution (1, 2) . Genetic study also strongly supports this separation. S race australis, with bluish neck, sometimes suggested to be a separate species, but differences are less marked than those of molybdophanes, in addition to which it appears genetically very similar to nominate and especially massaicus (3, 4). Race †syriacus (Arabia), closely related to nominate , extinct probably since 1960s. NW populations (Río de Oro) previously separated in race spatzi on basis of different pattern and structure of pores in eggshells, but detected differences now attributed to individual variation (5, 6, 7)."," Geographic Variation Subspecies differ mainly in colour of bare skin, presence/extent of white-feathered neck-ring, and extent of feathering on crown."," Subspecies Introduced to other parts of South Africa and locally in NW & SC Australia. SUBSPECIES Struthio camelus camelus Scientific name definitions S. c. camelus +1 Distribution W and S Sahara, and Sahel, from Mauritania E to Sudan and Eritrea, S to N Uganda. Identification Summary Male nominatebreeding has almost bare skin of most of head and neck and of thighs reddish, short stiff brownish feathers encircling bald crown and extending down hindneck; feathered lower neck black, bordered above by ring of white feathers; body and all wing-coverts black; remiges and tail white, sometimes stained brownish by soil; iris brown; upper mandible yellowish, lower mandible red; legs reddish. Non-breeding male is similar to breeding, but bare areas of neck and thighs duller, more pinkish (less red). Female is like male, but duller; dark feathers browner, less black, wing and tail greyer, bare areas duller and greyer, with greater amount of downy feathering; as with male, neck and bill become redder during breeding. SUBSPECIES Struthio camelus syriacus Scientific name definitions Distribution deserts of Syria and Arabia. SUBSPECIES Struthio camelus massaicus Scientific name definitions S. c. massaicus +2 Distribution S Kenya S to Tanzania. Identification Summary massaicus has neck-ring narrower than on nominate, crown mostly feathered, bare neckand thighs pinkish-grey (male redder during breeding), femalehas paler grey-brown body plumage. SUBSPECIES Struthio camelus australis Scientific name definitions S. c. australis +2 Distribution S Angola E to Zimbabwe and S Mozambique, and S to W and N South Africa. Identification Summary australis has crown feathered, bare neckgrey (male redder during breeding), lacks white neck-ring, has white to buff tail but often appears to be brown to brownish-cinnamon by soil staining.", Distribution Editor's Note: Additional distribution information for this taxon can be found in the 'Subspecies' article above. In the future we will develop a range-wide distribution article.," Habitat Variety of open, semi-arid plains, from desertto savanna; also open woodland. Does not require standing water. Indeed, it is associated with arid and semi-arid habitats and has an extremely frugal water economy, comparable to that of small desert birds ."," Movement Sedentary or nomadic, depending on habitat. In moister regions, for exampe near Nairobi, Kenya, the same individuals may remain for years in the same areas . In dry seasons or dry areas may travel long distances in search of food and water. In West Africa probably moves south during the dry season returning north with the rains ."," Diet and Foraging Mainly herbivorous, taking grasses, seeds and leaves; succulent plants very important in drier areas. Also eats some insects and small vertebrates. A study in the Namib desert found that Ostriches, unlike mammalian herbivores, uproot and swallow some plants whole, their gizzards allowing them to cope with abrasive silica found in the roots . Normally forages in groups, sometimes large ones, browsing close to ground. Commonly associates with Cattle Egrets (Bubulcus ibis) in parts of South Africa ."," Sounds and Vocal Behavior Male gives “Booming” calls, typically a deep ""boo boo booooh hooo"" repeated several times at short intervals, to proclaim territory and during display; this call sometimes triggered by nocturnal predator or other disturbance; also a soft ""booh"" or ""twoo"", normally used during disputes (and accompanied by threat, attack or retreat). Other calls include various whistles, snorts and guttural sounds. Also non vocal sounds, e.g. bill snapping and stomach-rumbling."," Breeding Season and strategy vary with region. Breeds mainly during start of rains, e.g. Jun–Oct in E Africa (Mar–Apr and Aug–Oct in SE Kenya), and nests started mostly during Jul–Jan in S of range; also, often breeds in dry season. Nests as solitary pair, or in group consisting of territorial male, one main female and one or more secondary females (termed “major hen” and “minor hens” ); both sexes often promiscuous, mating with several members of opposite sex . Nest built by male, a shallow scrape c. 3 m in diameter dug in soil or sand. Normally, major hen lays 5–11 eggs, and 2–5 minor hens lay 2–6 eggs each, all in common nest; eggshuge (average 159 x 130 mm), yellowish, becoming white; incubation by both sexes (of females, normally only major hen participating), period 42–46 days; chicks are spiky, have buff‑coloured down with some black linesand specks , leave nest at 3–5 days; fledging period 4–5 months, young full-grown at c. 18 months; young form large crèches, which may be accompanied by one or more adults for c. 9 months. Sexual maturity reached at 3–4 years. Life expectancy 30–40 years."," Conservation Status Conservation status on Birdlife LC Least Concern Not globally threatened (Least Concern). Frequent to locally abundant throughout most of range; rare at extremities of range. Preyed upon by lions locally but at least one study has found that they are taken less often than their abundance would suggest, perhaps because they represent a relatively small prey item. Numbers and range diminished in W & N; most N populations included in CITES I. Still relatively common in Zakouma National Park, in SE Chad ; estimated population of 100 individuals surviving in N Cameroon in late 1990s . Possibly extinct W of Chad; in Mauritania, reports of four or five individuals in Banc d’Arguin National Park in 2006 and 2007 and eggshell fragments from this species in Adrar in 2006 require confirmation. Dramatic decline documented in the 1990s at the Aïr and Ténéré National Nature Reserve, Niger, where the species seemed to have been severely persecuted during the civil war of 1991–1997 . Formerly camelus resident in W Sahara, SE Moroccoand adjacent areas in Algeria but hunted to extinction by the 1960s, most populations disappearing by the 1930s . Still common in parts of E Africa. Range of wild population in S Africa has contracted to NW; elsewhere in S only feral birds, mostly hybrids of indigenous race australis and introduced nominate race. Middle East race syriacus, formerly very numerous in Arabian Peninsula and N to Syria and Iraq, probably extinct since 1966; nominate race introduced in C Saudi Arabia since 1994, but breeding success generally very low . Main causes of this species’ decline are plume trade during 19th century and hunting and egg-collecting in 20th century; also loss of habitat, which is currently the main threat. The species is a common exhibit in zoos worldwide, breeding well; also, it is farmed as a source of food in S Africa and S USA (Florida), and has been introduced into S Australia from such farms. In recent years, farms have been established also in parts of Europe. Introgression between escaped or released birds of non-native subspecies may have resulted in some genetic contamination in Kenya and South Africa, with implications for breeding success ."
